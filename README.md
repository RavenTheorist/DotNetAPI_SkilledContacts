# DotNetAPI_SkilledContacts
This is a WepAPI made in .NET Core which showcases a handling of a list of Contacts linked to a list of Skills.

## How to use:
- Open the json appsettings json files and set the link to your SQL server there
- Generate the database: Go to the project folder containing the context **Contacts.Core.Skills.Infrastructure/**, and execute the following CLI command:
``dotnet ef database update``
- Launch the app using Contacts.API.UI -> **IIS Express**, which will open the Swagger page

## Please read this:
- Project made using VisualStudio 2019, ASP.Net Core 5.0 and Entity Framework Core 5.0.13
- The project contains a custom logger CustomMessageLogger.cs to catch exceptions and warning.
- Security was implemented, but commented/disabled for an easier use. CORS and JWT were implemented.
- Migrations were generated, this project uses a code first approach in terms of Database.
- Database server can be configured in the appsettings.json
- The CRUD methods for the Skills are defined in the DefaultSkillRepository.cs and called from the SkillsController using a mediator
- Some design patterns and principles were implemented in order to make the API more reliable, extensible and less prone to errors:
   - Hexagonal Architecture: Domain, Infrastructure and the API
   - Dependency Injections, following Microsoft Manual's advises and examples
   - Unity of Work
   - Repository
   - Mediator

## Improvements / going farther:
- Although a logger catching exceptions was implemented, we still need to add some more data validations when reading requests.
- Use some more detailed status codes in the controller, using specific attributes/tags [] for each method.
- Add CRUD endpoint for the ContactSkill joining table.

### API Goal:
Create the "Contacts API". It's a simple API, where a user can get a quick overview over all contacts resources like persons, skills...

The following use cases should be implemented:

#### UC1
Create an CRUD endpoint for managing contacts. A contact should have at least the following attributes and appropriate validation:
- Firstname
- Lastname
- Fullname
- Address
- Email
- Mobile phone number

#### UC2
Create a CRUD endpoint for skills. A contact can have multiple skills and a skill can belong to multiple contacts. A skill should have the following attributes and appropriate validation:
- Name
- Level (expertise)

#### UC3
Document your API with Swagger.

#### UC4 (optional)
Implement the following security aspects. All bullet points are optional and can be implemented partially.
- Authentication
- Authorization
    - Users can only change their contact
    - Have checks for skills changes (e.g. the current user canâ€™t change skills for other users)
